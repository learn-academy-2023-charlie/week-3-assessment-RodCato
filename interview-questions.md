# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: Jsx is a hybrid language of javascript and html used in react components.

Researched answer: JSX is a way of writing code in JavaScript that lets you define what a web page should look like, similar to how you write HTML. It's used in React, which is a library for making web pages that change and update in response to user actions. It allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code.

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager made by Facebook. It can be used to install packages and manage dependencies. 

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager and project manager developed by Facebook. It installs dependencies listed in the package.json file that are stored in a local directory called node-modules. It also creates a yarn.lock file to ensure all developers working on a project are using the same versions of the dependencies.

3. What is a React component? 

Your answer: A React component is piece of code that represents “something” in your application. Many components come together to make up one web application. Each component is a separate file.

Researched answer: A React component is a modular, reusable piece of code that is used to build web pages. You can define a component using either a class or a function. A component takes in properties (props) as inputs and returns a React element that describes what should be displayed on the screen.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State is a property of a component and can change over time. Props are a way to pass data between components.

Researched answer: State is defined and managed within a component and can only be accessed and modified from within that component. Props, are passed down from a parent component to its child components. They are used to provide information to a component, such as configuration or data to display.

5. What is the DOM? 

Your answer: DOM Is a method that allows for interaction wit a document displayed in a web browser.

Researched answer: Document Object Model provides a set fo methods and properties that can be used to manipulate a document. Using the DOM, web developers can create dynamic and interactive web pages that respond to user input and update content in real-time.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: Div tags are used for big portions of content and span tags are used for smaller pieces of content.

Researched answer: Div tag is used to group HTML elements together is commonly used to define sections of a web page and apply styles or other attributes to a group of elements. Span tag is used to group inline HTML elements together and is commonly used to apply styles or other attributes to a specific section of text or other inline elements. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming is when data and functions are bundled together into objects, which are self-contained and have a state and behavior. Each object can communicate with other objects, and its behavior can be controlled through the manipulation of its data.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. In Ruby, everything is an object, including data types like strings and numbers. This means that Ruby provides a rich set of built-in classes and methods that can be used to manipulate these objects.

3. Implicit return: A function returns its value by default.

4. Ruby blocks: In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed to a method as an argument. When a block is passed to a method, the method can yield control to the block, which can then execute its code and return control to the method. It is commonly used for iterating over arrays and hashes.

5. Ruby hashes: A Ruby hash is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. It is similar to an array, but instead of using integer indices to access elements, a hash uses keys, which can be any object.
